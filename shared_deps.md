This YAML structure outlines the plan for generating a simple Pong game in Python. The game will consist of three main files:

`main.py` is the entry point of the application. It will contain the `PongGame` class, which will manage the game loop, rendering, and input handling. It will also have a `main` function to start the game and an `on_key_press` function to handle key presses.

`game_objects.py` will define the `Paddle` and `Ball` classes, which will represent the player's paddle and the ball, respectively. Both classes will have variables to keep track of their positions and movements.

`settings.py` will contain various configuration settings that will be used throughout the game, such as screen dimensions, paddle sizes, and velocities.

The game will handle two paddles, with the player controlling one paddle using the 'up' and 'down' keys and the 'player 2' being controlled with 'w' and 'a' keys. There will be no scoring, and the primary goal is to ensure the paddles can move and collide with the ball upon the game starting.
